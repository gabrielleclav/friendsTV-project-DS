    #### Intro: 
    I chose to do this project because I 
    love the show Friends and I love NLP or 
    anything that is AI related! I loved binge watching Friends when I 
    was younger, so I decided to do an Natural Langauge Processing project using 
    their dialogues. I found a dataset with their transcripts in it. I was originally 
    web-scraping a website for it, and will definitely still work on it since there are 
    a bunch of different HTML tags used, making it a little bit more challenging.
    

    P.S. I have the Central Perk lego set ðŸ˜€

    #### Problem Statement:
    Through Natural Language Processing, people can give computers to understand text and spoken words. 
    This project is aimed to read in the Friends dataset from Enmory NLP's repository (Character Mining) with 
    the season, episode, character, and transcript columns, and build different models to see if each one can 
    correctly determine a character's dialogue.
