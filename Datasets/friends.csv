1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
1,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
1,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
1,03, The Thumb ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross

1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Okay, Pheebs"
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
1,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "

2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
2,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
2,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
2,03, The Thumb ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Okay, Pheebs"
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "
2,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.

3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
3,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
3,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
3,03, The Thumb ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Okay, Pheebs"
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "
3,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.

4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
4,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
4,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
4,03, The Thumb ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but

4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
4,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "

5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,

5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
5,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
5,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
5,03, The Thumb ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,

5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Okay, Pheebs"
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
5,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "

I work with!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,

hormones!"

just- I just wanna be married again!"

6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
6,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
6,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
6,03, The Thumb ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,

6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but

takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
6,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green.

7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure

throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her

7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"

7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
7,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
7,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
7,03, The Thumb ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,

7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
7,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but

8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
8,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
8,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
8,03, The Thumb ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "

check it out"
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "

8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY

8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "
8,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.

9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (entering from Monica's room)
Morning."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Morning, Paul."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Thank you!  Thank you so
much!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
9,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
9,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
9,03, The Thumb ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service

9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, no... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Light still out? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica and Phoebe, Shut up! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I think he's shy. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Yeah? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Then what? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, It was my first time. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Uh-huh.

haaaah! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, How long? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Excuse me?! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Where? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, He is so cute! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop
the—(pause)—wowww. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Really? 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Both," Hey, buddy. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Okay, Pheebs"
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Green. To the green. 
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
9,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "

0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Instead of...?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That's right.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Never had that dream.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, No.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Cookie?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Ohh.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Thanks.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, No you don't.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Sorry.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Rachel?!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, Hi. 
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, I'm all better now.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh God, is it
6"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Who's Paul?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Maybe. Joey
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, He finally asked you out?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Yes!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, (horrified) Really?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, A wandering?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Okay, sure."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Which goes where?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," I have no
idea."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, All finished!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, You guys.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Oh, God."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, You got screwed.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Oh my God!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Oh my God!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, -leg?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ooh, steer clear of you."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," That's right.
[Scene"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Shut up!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, That only took me an hour.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Isn't there?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, It's okay...
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Two years.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul," So you still think you, um... might want that
fifth date?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the

made coffee before in my entire life."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler, That is amazing.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, Congratulations. 
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Morning. Good morning.

much!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Stop!

0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, We'll talk later.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Paul, Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Okayyy! (They do so.)
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, Big time!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica, What for?
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross and Rachel, Goodnight.
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,All, Yes!
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Ross," There's an image.
"
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,,
0,01, Monica Gets A Roommate ,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,Mr. Geller," Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. "
0,02, The Sonogram At The End ,,
0,03, The Thumb ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All," Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, How does she do that? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, What's going on with you? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Why? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Thanks. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out"
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, So? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Ohhh. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, What are you doing? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, You got it.
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Oh! Yeah! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, What? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Peach pit. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey, -Peaches? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki," Well, the biggest news is still you dumping
Barry at the altar! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Okay. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne, When are you coming home? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joanne," C'mon, this is us. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Kiki, Waitressing? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, What's that? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Floopy? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Yeah. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, He's open! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,All, Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (holds up her hand—she is on the
phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill
these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist," Well, you'll have to wait your turn. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Receptionist, (sarcastic) Any minute now. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Phoebe? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, What? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,,
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica, I see pizza! 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
0,04, George Stephanopoulos ,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "

through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
