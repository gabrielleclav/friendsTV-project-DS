    Friends is a 90s sitcom, based in Manhattan, NYC, where six friends go through life experiences

    Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Rachel Green, Ross Geller, Monica Geller,  and Joey Tribbiani, respectively.

    #### Intro: 
    I chose to do this project because I 
    love the show Friends and I love NLP or 
    anything that is AI related! I loved binge watching Friends when I 
    was younger, so I decided to do an Natural Langauge Processing project using 
    their dialogues. I found a dataset with their transcripts in it. I was originally 
    web-scraping a website for it, and will definitely still work on it since there are 
    a bunch of different HTML tags used, making it a little bit more challenging.
    Here is the github repository: [github](https://github.com/gabrielleclav/friendsTV-project-DS)
    

    P.S. I have the Central Perk lego set üòÄ

    """)
    st.write(""" 
    #### Problem Statement:
    Through Natural Language Processing, people can give computers to understand text and spoken words. 
    This project is aimed to read in the Friends dataset from Enmory NLP's repository (Character Mining) with 
    the season, episode, character, and transcript columns, and build different models to see if each one can 
    correctly determine a character's dialogue.

    st.write("""
    #### Modeling:

    I coded five different models for the multiclass classification: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Ada Boost, N√§ive
    Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Out of all these models, the Logistic Regression one was the best model. It scored the highest 
    on the testing set and did well with predictions. Even though the ada boost did best with not overfitting the training set, it 
    did one of the worst jobs at predicting (KNN was bad also). In the Make a Prediction: All Characters page, it will make predictions
    from the logistic regression model and the ada boost model to display the differences in the models. As for the 
    Make a Predictions: Couples Edition page, I only display predictions from a logistic regression model. 
    Note: Obviously, these models are not perfect, and do not always make the right predictions, however, they do make a lot 
    of correct predictions.
